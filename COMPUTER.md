Computer components communicate through buses.

* **CPU** executes instructions and controls operations.
* **Memory (RAM)** stores instructions and data for fast access.
* **I/O devices** handle input (keyboard, mouse) and output (screen, printer).

They connect through **buses**:

* **Data bus** moves actual data.
* **Address bus** specifies where in memory or I/O to read/write.
* **Control bus** carries signals (read, write, clock, interrupt).

The CPU issues commands on the control bus, places addresses on the address bus, and exchanges data over the data bus. Memory and I/O respond according to these signals.
