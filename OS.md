1. **Telemetry**

   * Windows 10 and 11 collect a lot of usage data by default (telemetry). Some of it can be reduced, but not fully disabled.
   * Linux distributions generally do not collect telemetry unless you explicitly enable it. Ubuntu collects a small amount, but Arch, Debian, Fedora, etc. collect none by default.

2. **Bloat**

   * Windows ships with preinstalled apps (OneDrive, Xbox services, Cortana, Widgets, etc.) that consume resources even if you donâ€™t use them.
   * Some Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora) come with many default apps, but you can choose minimal or lightweight distros (Arch, Debian netinstall, Alpine, Void Linux) where you only install what you want.

3. **Performance on slow hardware**

   * Windows struggles on old CPUs and integrated graphics because of background services, animations, and heavy system processes.
   * Linux can be very lightweight. For example, XFCE, LXQt, or even tiling window managers (i3, bspwm) run smoothly on old machines. Your example (i5-2400, Intel HD 2000, 16GB RAM) would perform much better on Linux than Windows 10/11.
   * Arch, Debian, and lightweight spins (Xubuntu, Lubuntu, MX Linux) are often used on old PCs.

4. **Customization**

   * Windows allows only limited customization (themes, wallpapers, third-party tools).
   * Linux allows deep customization: desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.), window managers, ricing (making your desktop look unique with polybar, dmenu, custom themes).

### Extra points not in the comment:

* **Security**: Linux is generally more secure by design. No need for heavy antivirus.
* **Open source**: Code transparency, community support, and free software.
* **Package managers**: apt, pacman, dnf, etc. let you install and update everything from one place. No need to download installers from random sites.
* **Stability vs bleeding-edge**: Distros like Debian and CentOS focus on stability. Arch and Fedora give you the latest software. You pick what fits.
* **Downside**: Gaming and specialized software (like Adobe suite) still run better on Windows, although Steam Proton and Wine have closed much of the gap.
